## Project: Identify Customer Segments

### Introduction
Project code for Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree program. In this Project, we're going to look at relationships between demographics features, organize the population into clusters, and see how prevalent customers are in each of the segments obtained.

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

We recommend students install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project.

### Data

The data for this project from Arvato with Terms and Conditions. So it's not appropriate to put in public github. 

### Code and files

Latest Code is provided in the `Identify_Customer_Segments (submit2).ipynb` notebook file. You will also be required to use `mix_feature_PRAEGENDE_JUGENDJAHRE.csv` file to complete the work. 
Result can be seen in `Identify_Customer_Segments (submit2).html`.
